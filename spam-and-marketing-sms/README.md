# spam and marketing SMS
*last updated: 23 Dec 2024 (n=5,241)*

Every text message I personally received since September 29, 2022, timestamped and tagged with its category.

## motivation

We usually consider spam as digital detritus: something that clogs the servers, something to *junk*, something to *purge*. We feel like this should be a solved problem by now, and yet the only texts we ever get are spam.

But in the way one can learn a lot about someone by going through their trash â€” what they had for lunch, what they bought, what they buy into â€” perhaps one can also learn about a society by the spam it tries to erase.

Or perhaps not! But we'll never know unless we study it, and we can't study it without preserving it. Thus this dataset.

At the start of data collection, I wanted to eventually be able to chart my personal history with spam on a [timeline like this](https://spamofthetimes.com):

![Screenshot of a chart entitled 'spam of the times' showing the count of spam texts received per day betwen September 2022 and February 2024](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scottleechua/spam-of-the-times/main/assets/header_spamofthetimes.png)

Consequently, this spam dataset has some unconventional features:

1. **Timestamps.** [Most spam datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset) don't have timestamps because they're constructed as training data for [spam detection models](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/228/sms+spam+collection), which just need the message text and the label. In contrast, a dataset with timestamps lets you explore the **seasonality** of spam: how do the messages change over time? is there more or less spam on holidays? how do events like[ mandatory SIM registration](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2022/09/28/2212803/senate-approves-sim-registration-bill) affect spam volumes?
2. **More granular categories.** Instead of the usual binary label of spam vs. ham [(i.e., non-spam)](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/spamassassin/Ham), I sort texts into [five categories](#categories) â€” `spam`, `ads`, `gov`, `notifs`, or `OTP`. This better captures the reality that not all ham is equal: we treat OTPs and government PSAs very differently.
3. **Complete message history.** Every text message I've received since the start of data collection is a row in the dataset. While I do redact some messages and sender identities for privacy, I don't drop rows. This lets me ask: what fraction of my messages in a given day or month were spam?

## categories
Each message is assigned one of the following categories:

1. `spam` â€” unsolicited messages from unknown senders.
2. `ads` â€” marketing messages from known businesses or services, such as GCash and Smart.
3. `gov` â€” public service announcements from Philippine government agencies, such as [NTC](https://ntc.gov.ph/) and [NDRRMC](https://ndrrmc.gov.ph/).
4. `notifs` â€” a catch-all category for legitimate and private messages, such as transaction confirmations, delivery updates, and a handful of personal conversations.
5. `OTP` â€” genuine one-time passwords.

## data dictionary

One row corresponds to one SMS.

Column | Definition
---|-------------
`date-received` | Datetime SMS was received in timezone `UTC+8`.
`date-read` | Datetime SMS was read in timezone `UTC+8`.
`sender` | A partially-masked phone number, unmasked alphanumeric [Sender ID](https://api.support.vonage.com/hc/en-us/articles/217571017-What-types-of-Sender-IDs-are-there), or one of three special values: <br> â€¢ `redacted_contact` if sender is a person in my personal contact book; <br>â€¢ `redacted_individual` if sender is a person not in my contacts and the message is solicited (e.g., updates from delivery riders); or <br> â€¢ `redacted_business` if sender is a business/service and **all** their messages are solicited.
`category` | Takes one of five possible values: `spam`, `ads`, `gov`, `notifs`, or `OTP`. See categories above.
`text` | â€¢ Full text for `spam`, `ads`, and `gov`. <br> â€¢ `<REDACTED>` for texts that are `notifs` or `OTP`.

## cautions and limitations

- This dataset only contains SMS, so examples of WhatsApp / Viber / Telegram spam are unfortunately not captured.
- Don't try to create a blocklist or identify specific numbers in the `sender` column. Spammers have almost definitely left those numbers behind in favor of fresh ones, and there's a chance some old numbers have already been [recycled back into circulation as legitimate numbers](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/cuz0fn/recycled_phone_number/).
- This dataset consists of a single data subject â€” me! - so be wary about what insights from the data might generalize (e.g., spam trends and seasonality) vs. what might not (e.g., % of messages that are spam).

## data preprocessing

I export SMS history to `csv` using [iMazing](https://imazing.com/transfer-iphone-text-messages-to-computer). Then I sort and redact the data using a combination of sender whitelists (e.g., my phone contacts) and key phrase search (e.g., "OTP"). Finally, I check each row manually to correct any wrong labels.

For privacy reasons, I don't release the raw iMazing exports or my whitelists.
